For my project, I analyzed the relationship between NBA player performance and salary to understand which players provide the best and worst value for their teams. Using data from the 2016 and 2017 seasons, I merged detailed player statistics, such as points per game (PPG), player efficiency rating (PER), and defensive win shares (DWS).I did this with salary information to build predictive models that estimate what players should be paid based on their production. After exploring correlations and testing different model selection methods, including best subset, forward, and backward selection, I found that a simpler model using just age, PPG, and DWS explained a significant portion of salary variation. I then validated the model by comparing predicted and actual free agent salaries, discovering clear patterns of under and overvaluation across players.
From a business standpoint, I see this type of analysis as highly valuable for NBA front offices. It quantifies how efficiently teams spend their salary cap space and provides a data driven way to evaluate player contracts, anticipate market values in free agency, and identify undervalued players before their price rises. Beyond contract negotiations, this approach could help inform scouting and player development by revealing which performance metrics most influence a player’s earning potential. In essence, the project demonstrates how data analytics can bridge on court performance with financial decision making, giving teams a strategic edge in roster construction and long term planning.
